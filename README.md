# Ariadne's Maze

Built for HackHarvard 2015, this is an educational maze game that can be played using a phone and Google Cardboard.  It was developed using Unity, C#, and Autodesk Maya.

This is still a work in progress, but eventually, you will be able to answer trivia questions about Greek mythology to proceed through a maze, and once you've found the center of the maze, fight a velociraptor.
